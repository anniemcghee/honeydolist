# Pre-work - *Honeydo List*

**Honeydo List** is an Android app that allows users to build a todo list to share. Users can add, edit and delete list entries until they're ready to text the list to their "honey".

Submitted by: **Annie McGhee**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit dialog for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

## Notes

Most of debugging time spent trying to access the text field on the modify dialog - I was inflating the view improperly for awhile. Definitely spent some time trying different approaches.
